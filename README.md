# Joku - A Roku CLI
Why not? If you spend a lot of time in your terminal, why not control your TV from there.

This is a wrapper around Roku's [External Control Protocol](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/external-control-api.md)

## Setup
We need a configuration file, `$HOME/.config/joku/config.toml`, to store your Roku device IP and available applications.

You can create one by executing `joku discover` and following the prompt.
